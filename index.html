<!--Backround Story-->
<section class="story">
    <p>
        In 2021, I received the call no person ever wants to receive. My
        gynechologist called to tell me that my recent diagnostic tests came
        back showing that I had Invasive Lobular Carcinoma. BREAST CANCER. He
        proceeded to tell me that it's a more rare form, only 15% of BC cases
        are typically ILC. Needless to say, I was in shock.
      </p>

      <p>
        What led to this diagnosis was a series of tests which started with an
        annual mammogram. I had been getting mammograms since I was 35 because
        my mother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer that year. At 41, this
        annual test had become a mere formality. I never thought I'd get
        cancer!
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm here to tell you that while a Breast Cancer diagnosis is scary,
        arming yourself with knowledge will help in the fight and calm your fears!
