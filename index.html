<div class="intro">
     <p>In 2021, I received the call no person ever wants to receive. My
         gynechologist called to tell me that my recent diagnostic tests came
         back showing that I had Invasive Lobular Carcinoma. BREAST CANCER. He
         proceeded to tell me that it's a more rare form, only 15% of BC cases
         are typically ILC. Needless to say, I was in shock.
        What led to this diagnosis was a series of tests which started with an
         annual mammogram. I had been getting mammograms since I was 35 because
         my mother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer that year. At 41, this
         annual test had become a mere formality. I never thought I'd get
         cancer!
        <p>I'm here to tell you that while a Breast Cancer diagnosis is scary,
         arming yourself with knowledge will help in the fight and calm your fears!

    <h3>Coping with a Diagnosis</h3>
    <p>People cope with the news of a diagnosis in different ways.  In my case, to help with fear and anxiety
        I talked to people in my support system regularly about what I was feeling. They gave me permission to 
        have whatever emotion surfaced.</p>
      <p>Also, the weekend prior to my surgery to remove the cancer, I got a new puppy!  A rambunctious 8-week old Vizsla.
          Pets make everything better.</p>
