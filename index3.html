          In 2021, I received the call no person ever wants to receive. My
          gynechologist called to tell me that my recent diagnostic tests came
          back showing that I had Invasive Lobular Carcinoma. BREAST CANCER. He
          proceeded to tell me that it's a more rare form, only 15% of BC cases
          are typically ILC. Needless to say, I was in shock.
        </p>

        <p>
          What led to this diagnosis was a series of tests which started with an
          annual mammogram. I had been getting mammograms since I was 35 because
          my mother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer that year. At 41, this
          annual test had become a mere formality. I never thought I'd get
          cancer!
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm here to tell you that while a Breast Cancer diagnosis is scary,
          arming yourself with knowledge will help in the fight and calm your fears!
